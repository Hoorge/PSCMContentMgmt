TODO: explain how $CMSiteServer and $CMSiteCode are set
TODO: highlight that this isn't most efficient because some (if not all) functions do not make use of the configmgr cmdlet parameters which accept arrays. doing so could offer a performance gain. this module opts not to do that for the benefit of getting success/failure results for each action made on an object.
TODO: i know -SiteServer and -SiteCode use [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()] attribute, but there's a check for $null also in begin {} for most functions because the [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()] attribute doesn't work for parameter default values, which this module heavily uses. $CMSiteServer and $CMSiteCode are auto set upon module import, and these are default values for all functions with params -SiteServer and -SiteCode. the values of these variables are sniffed from registry and remote WMI.
