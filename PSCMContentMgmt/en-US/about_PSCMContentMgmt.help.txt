SHORT DESCRIPTION
    An overview of the PSCMContentMgmt module.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Distribution Points are undoubtedly the most common site system type
    to install on servers at remote sites. 

    This module soughts to help you manage them by giving you functions to:
        
        * Query distribution points and distribution point groups, and identify
        what content objects are distributed to them
        * Compare distributed content objects between two distribution points 
        or distribution point groups
        * Redistribute or distribute content objects returned by this module 
        to other distribution points or distribution point groups
        * Invoke the DP content library cleanup tool
        * Export and import .pkgx files
        * Find any object with any given Configuration Manager ID

    Several of the functions in this module are wrappers for cmdlets
    in the Configuration Manager module. PSCMContentMgmt does not attempt to
    reinvent the wheel from these cmdlets, but instead provide a simpler
    workflow for managing distribution points and their content.

    The simple workflow offers you:
    
        * Pipeline support so you can easily progress through the motions
        for tasks such as querying content on a distribution point
        and distributing it to another, or finding all content objects
        which failed to distribute and initiate a redistribution
        * Consistent property names when dealing with different types of
        content objects
        * Provide functionality which the Configuration Manager module does
        not provide (e.g. content redistribution or import .pkgx files)

    It is worth pointing out, that in those scenarios where a PSCMContentMgmt
    function is invoking a Configuration Manager module cmdlet, any caught
    exceptions are forwarded on to you as the user. The Configuration Manager
    module (at the time of writing this) is notoriously for its generic
    and "catch-all" stype exception handling.

    In other words, if an exception is thrown a Configuration Manager cmdlet
    and the error message is vague or misleading, don't blame me :-).
